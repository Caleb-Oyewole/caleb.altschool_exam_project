Let's break down this project into manageable steps. Imagine you're building a digital piggy bank to keep track of your expenses. This project involves creating two main components:
 * Expense Class: This is like a single entry in your piggy bank. Each entry has a unique ID, a title (e.g., "Lunch"), an amount, and timestamps for when it was created and last updated.
 * ExpenseDB Class: This acts as the piggy bank itself, holding a collection of Expense objects. It allows you to add new expenses, remove them, find them by ID or title, and view all your expenses.
Here's a simplified way to think about the code:

To use this code:
 * Save it: Save the code as a Python file (e.g., expense_tracker.py).
 * Run it: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run it using python expense_tracker.py.
This will execute the code and perform the actions you've programmed (like adding and retrieving expenses). You can expand this code to build a more complete expense tracking application.
